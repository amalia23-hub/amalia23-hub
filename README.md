## Hi everyone, I'm Amalia 

👩🏻‍💻 I'm an optimistic 28 years old automated software engineer that's eager to learn and improve at any moment. <br>

👩🏻‍💻 I've studied Automation and Computers in the Systems Engineering department. <br>
👩🏻‍🎓 I've graduated in 2021 when I got my master degree in Automated Systems Engineering at Polytechnic University, Romania. 

💻 I did my summer practice as a software development technician at Veoneer Romania, an automotive company. 
During this time I created software requirements, components design and test specifications for different components, working with Visual Studio Code and with markdown.

💻 I worked for Nokia Networks Romania, a telecommunications company being a technical content development intern and part of both CMS support team and graphic design team.
Gained experience leading website design projects (working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS), including gathering user requirements, producing code, enhancing designs to wow customers.

💻 Currently working as a flight planner admin for Newrest, a multi-soctor catering company in UK. 
Using Microsoft Access database management system for scheduling and monitoring flights to make sure we meet customer expectations. 

⚡ Fun fact: I love smart, open and funny people, I have a passion for books & poetry 📚 and I enjoy traveling 🌍 with all my heart. <br>
⚡ 2nd fun fact: I have a passion for front-end development and on the back-end side I prefer C++.

💙 My favorite motto is indeed: "We shall never know all the good a simple smile can do!". ☺️
